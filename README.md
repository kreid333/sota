# SOTA Window Coverings

## Description 

This is a window treatment website, designed and developed by me, for a window treatement company. I created this using the MERN stack; but instead of React I used Gatsby.js for its speed. Additionally, Nodemailer is utilized to send emails via the contact form.

To use this application, run 'npm install' to install all of the packages listed as dependencies for both the server and React.

The user must run `npm start` in order to start both the Express server and the Gatsby client simultaneously.
